I allow students to read my code for reference, but submitting the code and artwork as part of a coursework examination could be a clear case of cheating and plagiarism. These students could be in violation of the Code of Student Conduct, which may have dramatic consequences such as getting expelled. Code adaptation and artwork by Sabrina Palis, Dec, 28t 2018.
